GO TO THE DOGS
If something “goes to the dogs,” it means it goes bad, deteriorates, or becomes poor-quality.
If you make a suggestion to “let sleeping dogs lie,” it means not to talk about things in the past that might cause problems if you mention them today. This idiom comes from the fact that a sleeping dog is peaceful, but if you wake it up, it might be angry and bite you.
